# _Epicodus Independent Project - February 7, 2020_

#### By _**Brandan Sayarath**_

## Description

This is the Epicodus independent end-of-week assignment for Friday, February 7, 2020.  The purpose of this assignment is to create an application that will convert the user's "earth age" into their age on the planet Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.  

This application will also determine how many years the user has left to live on each planet, depending on the user's average life expectancy for their demographic.  If the user has already surpassed their average life expectancy, the program will return the number of years they have lived past their life expectancy.
